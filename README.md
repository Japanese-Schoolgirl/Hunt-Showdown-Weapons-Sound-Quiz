# Hunt Showdown Weapons Sound Quiz
A badly written application by friend's request. Feel free to use this code or application itself if you want (not for commercial purposes, of course).
Application was compiled with Tauri and is unlikely to run on an older version of Windows.
Also a special thanks to the site "https://hunt.kamille.ovh/", it helped with the collection of sounds.

P.S. This application scans only the "Sounds" folder and makes lists based on its structure.
